<h1>Game Playing</h1>
<b>Zero-sum</b>: one player's loss is the other's gain
<b>Discrete</b>: states and decisions have discrete values
<b>Finite</b>: countable number of states and decisions
<b>Deterministic</b>: not up to chance (like dice rolls or coin flips)
<b>Perfect information</b>: each player can see the complete game state, no simultaneous decisions
<b>Game Theoretic Value</b> (minimax value) = the score of the terminal node that will be reached if both players play optimally

<h2>Minimax Algorithm</h2>
<p>The minimax algorithm is implemented as a modified version of <b>DFS</b>. Game theoretic value is computed from the bottom up, with the Max player choosing the highest score possible and the Min player choosing the lowest score.</p>

<b>Time Complexity</b>: O(b<sup>m</sup>)
<b>Space Complexity</b>: O(bm)

<h2>Alpha-Beta Pruning</h2>
<p>Alpha-beta is a search algorithm that restricts the set of possible solutions based on the portion of the search tree that has already been seen.</p>
<p><b>&alpha;</b> = the <i>maximum lower bound</i> of possible solutions, the best Max can do</p>
<p><b>&beta;</b> = the <i>minimum upper bound</i> of possible solutions, the best Min can do</p>
